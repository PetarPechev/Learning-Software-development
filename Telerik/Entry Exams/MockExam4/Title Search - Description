Title Search
You will receive a string title which contains only small latin letters [a-z]. After that you will have to read from the input N lines of text. For each of these lines, your task is to find out if there is such a sequence in the string you receive as input on the first line (title). The sequence may not be on consecutive indices. Each time you find a sequence of these characters you remove it from the initial string and print the modified string. If no such sequence is found you have to print No such title found! and not modify the string.

Examples:
telerik is found in telerikacademy and the remaining string is academy
telerik is also found in tpeplpeprik and the remaining string is pppp
